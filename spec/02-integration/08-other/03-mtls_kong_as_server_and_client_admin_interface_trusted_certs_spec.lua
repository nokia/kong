-- This test verifies Kong to Client mTLS, as well as Client to Kong mTLS.
-- Note, that Kong talks to itself, so the flow is following:
-- Kong is triggered with resty.http client (via HTTP)
-- Kong handles request and sends to the upstream (to itself in fact)
-- Kong gets request and verifies client certificate. Since it talks to itself, the client is Kong as well, so
-- we test Kong as a Client as well as Kong as a server in the same test. :)
